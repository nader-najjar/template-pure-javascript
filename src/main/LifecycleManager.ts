/**
 * Manages application lifecycle and graceful shutdown.
 *
 * <p>Shutdown pattern:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>SIGTERM/SIGINT fires the registered shutdown hook, which sets a flag and waits on a latch.</li>
 *   <li>Long-running executors observe {@link isShutdownRequested} at safe boundaries
 *       (e.g., between loop iterations) and stop accepting new work.</li>
 *   <li>Main performs all resource cleanup in its own {@code finally} block, then calls
 *       {@link signalDone} to unblock the hook.</li>
 *   <li>The process exits after Main calls process.exit().</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Correctness is guaranteed by idempotency: dying at any point (including SIGKILL,
 * which bypasses hooks entirely) leaves the system in a consistent state. Graceful
 * shutdown only improves efficiency - it is never required for correctness.
